#CrackCoordinateTransformations

Final project for CE 8351: Analytic Element Modeling 

This solution uses the Muskhelishvili-Kolosov complex potential function method for displacement and stress. 
This method is based off of Hooke's Law and equilibrium.
Couchy integrals are used to find constants that satisfy boundary conditions. 

Run.m is a MATLAB script that defines the parameters of the material, the crack, and the half-space and runs the program to generate plots of displacement and stress.

The Project Documentation folder contains a PDF of a walkthrough of the mathematical solution as well as a description of the code used to solve the problem. 

The code description found in CE8351 Analytic Element Modeling Presentation.pdf file was used as an introduction to OOP for the audience, as the entire class had been taught using procedural programming and I programmed my final project in OOP paradigm for funsies. A sample of my procedural-style work in MATLAB can be found in the AEM_Cylinder_Fluid_Dynamics repository.
